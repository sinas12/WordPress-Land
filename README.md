## ⚙️ Tailwind & Flowbite Setup

This project currently loads **Tailwind CSS** and **Flowbite** via **CDN links** inside `header.php` ; this keeps things simple for beginners.

However, for **best practices and production use**, you should **install both libraries locally instead of relying on CDN**.

👉 Please refer to the official documentation of each:

- Flowbite Docs: https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart/  
- Tailwind CSS Docs: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/tailwind-cli
